(Dir contains a complete collectd checkout where I'm toying with 0MQ plugin.)


ExtreMon collectd plugin
------------------------

BUILDING:
--------

1) Get collectd source tree. E.g. from

http://collectd.org/files/collectd-5.0.2.tar.bz2

and unpack it.

-------------------------

2) add to src/Makefile.am

---cut here---
if BUILD_PLUGIN_WRITE_EXTREMON
pkglib_LTLIBRARIES += write_extremon.la
write_extremon_la_SOURCES = write_extremon.c
write_extremon_la_LDFLAGS = -module -avoid-version
write_extremon_la_CFLAGS = $(AM_CFLAGS)
write_extremon_la_CXXFLAGS = -DCOLLECT_DEBUG
collectd_LDADD += "-dlopen" write_extremon.la
collectd_DEPENDENCIES += write_extremon.la
endif
---cut here---

--------------------------

3) add to configure.in


---cut here---
AC_PLUGIN([write_extremon],  [yes],          [extremon cauldron output plugin])
---cut here---

among the other AC_PLUGIN near the head of the file,

---cut here---
write_extremon  . . . $enable_write_extremon
---cut here---

among the other enable_somethings nearer the end of the file


---------------------------

4) add write_extremon.c to the src directory

---------------------------

5) ./configure, make, make install as per instructions in http://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/First_steps

(You should see write_extremon -- yes near the end of the ./configure step)

----------------------------

6) Edit the collectd.conf you just installed

add:

---cut here---
LoadPlugin write_extremon
---cut here---

somewhere in the list of LoadPlugins


add a write_extremon plugin block (somewhere among the other Plugin blocks)

---cut here---
<Plugin write_extremon>
    Host "224.0.0.1"
    Port 1248
    Prefix "be.apsu.thoth"
</Plugin>
---cut here---

Make sure to set the prefix to something that makes sense to you, not "be.apsu.thoth" which is my laptop.

---------------------------

7) start your collectd. You should now see shuttles appear in the multicast group you set in your config, above.
For example, using socat:

$ socat UDP4-RECVFROM:1248,ip-add-membership=224.0.0.1:192.168.2.214 STDIO

(replace 192.168.2.214 by your IP address, make sure you use the same multicast group (address) and port that is in your write_extremon Plugin config in collectd.conf

Note: Unless you have some other process that has joined the right multicast group, you won't be able to see the packets using e.g. tcpdump.

--------------------------

8) I need to make this easier..
